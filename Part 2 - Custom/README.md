# Part 2 - Dynamics simulation using muscle models #
In this part of the workshop, you will run how to simulate a dynamics model with a biophysical muscle model based on cross-bridge dynamics.  

**Learning Objectives**
At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:
- Simulate a one degree-of-freedom model with one muscle to study knee pendulum test
- Simulate a one degree-of-freedom model with one muscles to study standing posture control under perturbation 

**Assignment 2.1: Knee pendulum test simulation demonstrates history-dependence of the biophysical model**
- Code: Part 2-Custom/kneeTest.m
- Run the code (F5 on Windows)
- Click on the force time series (middle row) to visualize the crossbridge distribution (bottom left) underlying the force at that moment in time. Observe the difference between isometric vs. pre-movement conditions. 
- Bonus: Change baseline activation and run the code again. Try pCa = 6.7, 6.9, 7.2, 8

**Assignment 2.2: Standing balance simulation with agonist-antagonist muscle pair**
- Code: Part 2-Custom/standingBalance.m
- Run the code (F5 on Windows)
- Bonus: Change baseline activation and run the code again.
